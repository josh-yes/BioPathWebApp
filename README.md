# BioPathWebApp
An interactive web app for displaying metabolic pathways with the goal of making learning biochemistry easier for students.

This is just a copy of the private BioPath repository where development continues.

I worked on this project as part of a senior design team with three other contributors. The Python code and other backend scripts are all my work. I also contributed to the frontend React code, helped with AWS deployment, and contributed to the overall architecture decisions. Thanks to Ben, Cole, and Zach for your help making this project a reality.

I will add a link to the site once it gets deployed (soon). Feel free to email me with any questions or comments: joshschmitz88@gmail.com
