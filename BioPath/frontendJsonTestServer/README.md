# Mock JSON Server

### How it works
Documentation can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#getting-started)

This is a simple service which allows us to quickly spin up a mock backend 
which we will use for testing. 

### Files
1. **db.json:** contains the sample JSON data we will be using 
1. **routes.json** specify custom routes (you will need to given our naming structure for the django backend will be different)

### Commands
**npm run json:server-only** (runs the server only) 

*NOTE*: You can change this command within the package.json scripts
